# PLResults

This was a quick project to test out Express which I spent a weekend learning the basics of and implementing with Node and a free API service.

The free API service was for [football-data.org](http://api.football-data.org/docs/v1/index.html#_api_behaviour).
Docs in the link.

It was a quick little challenge, integrating Bootstrap for a table (something that was new to me and showed me how fantastic a tool Bootstrap can be for tables!) and allowing me the chance to play with Handlebars for the first time in about 6 months.

A quick lesson and a nice bit of fun.

To run:
* Clone the repository
* NPM install
* NPM start
* Go to localhost:3000
